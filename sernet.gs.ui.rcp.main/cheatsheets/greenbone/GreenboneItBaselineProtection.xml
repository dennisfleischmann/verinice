    <description>
      In connection with a <b>Greenbone</b> vulnerability scanner (<b>www.greenbone.net</b>) as well as a OpenVAS
      vulnerability scanner (<b>www.openvas.org</b>) verinice enables an effective vulnerability management.<br />
      <br />
      Importing the results of a vulnerability scan into verinice in the classic IT-Baseline-Protection according to the BSI standards of the 100 series provides the
      functionalities structural analysis, modeling and automatic basisc security check.<br/>
      Due to the limited availability of implementation notes, the Greenbone/OpenVAS connection is not available for the Modernised IT-Baseline Protection.

      previously added modules.<br />
      <br />
      The automatic basic security check transfers only those controls from BSI module layers 4 an 5, due to the
      reason that non technical controls can not be scanned by the vulnerability scanner.
